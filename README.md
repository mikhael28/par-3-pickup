## What features does SP3 bring?

- Service Worker functionality, creating a smooth offline experience.
- Single player achievements, keeping you engaged even when playing a terrible round of golf.
- Multiplayer skins/record tracking (temporarily disabled while refactoring multiplayer to support websockets and RT data processsing)
- Payment processing using Ethereum and MetaMask (a proof of concept, probably not a long term feature)
